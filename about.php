					<h1>About</h1>
					<p>This website is obviously under construction but I doubt too many people are looking at it right now. It's coming along quite well though so check back soon! </p>

					<p>I was in the vending industry for 12 years before and I wanted to change careers. In 2016 when I decided to begin my web development journey by taking online classes for web development. In 2018 I obtained my first position as a Front-End Web Developer and have been in love with all things web development ever since! </p>

					<p>In my freetime I enjoy cycling, snowboarding, playing guitar, videogames, chasing my toddler around and obviously...Web Development</p>
